# Number_Guessing_Game_with_Speech_Recognition

> Created the simple Number Guessing Game but with a bit of modification , by adding speech recognition to it. Used The Speech Recognition API to recognise the speech and add functionality to it.

# Usage

```sh
# Creating A new Speech Recognition Object
let recognition = new window.SpeechRecognition();
# Starting the Speech Recognition
recognition.start();
```
